# Stock Market Analysis Report Generator

This repository contains a Python script to generate a daily HTML report for Indian stock market analysis, covering both index stocks and custom user-provided stocks. The report aims to provide insights into whether stocks are at a good valuation for investment based on common technical and fundamental metrics.

## Features

*   Fetches latest stock data from Yahoo Finance.
*   Calculates common technical indicators:
    *   Simple Moving Averages (SMA - 50 & 200 day)
    *   Relative Strength Index (RSI - 14 day)
    *   Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD - 12, 26, 9 day)
    *   Bollinger Bands (20 day)
*   Extracts key fundamental ratios:
    *   Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
    *   Earnings Per Share (EPS)
    *   Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
    *   Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio (Note: Currently 'N/A' as it requires deeper balance sheet parsing not yet implemented)
    *   Dividend Yield
    *   Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) Ratio
*   Generates basic textual inferences based on RSI, Price vs SMA50, and P/E ratio.
*   Produces an HTML report with:
    *   Key metrics tables for each stock/index.
    *   Price charts (including SMAs and Bollinger Bands).
    *   Volume charts (for individual stocks).
    *   RSI charts.
    *   MACD charts.
*   Modern and clean visual styling for the HTML report.
*   Customizable list of stocks/indices via `stocks_list.csv`.
*   Includes a `setup.sh` script for easy environment setup.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   `venv` module for Python (usually included with Python 3)

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Run the Setup Script:**
    This script will create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    The script will guide you. After it runs, you **must** activate the virtual environment in your current terminal session:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *Note for Windows users:* You might need to use a Git Bash terminal or WSL to run the `.sh` script, or manually create the virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`) and activate it (`.venv\Scripts\activate`), then install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).

3.  **Customize Stock List (Optional):**
    Edit the `stocks_list.csv` file to include the Indian stock tickers (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`, `INFY.NS`) or index tickers (e.g., `^NSEI` for NIFTY 50, `^BSESN` for SENSEX) you want to analyze. Each ticker should be on a new line under the "Ticker" header.

4.  **Generate the Report:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is activated. Then run the script:
    ```bash
    python report_generator.py
    ```

5.  **View the Report:**
    Open the generated `stock_report.html` file in your web browser. Charts will be located in the `charts/` directory and are embedded in the HTML report.

## Metrics Used

### Technical Indicators

*   **Simple Moving Average (SMA):**
    *   Periods: 50-day and 200-day.
    *   Purpose: Shows the average price over a specified period, helping to identify medium-term and long-term trends. Crossovers (e.g., 50-day crossing above 200-day - "Golden Cross") can signal momentum shifts.
*   **Relative Strength Index (RSI):**
    *   Period: 14-day.
    *   Purpose: A momentum oscillator measuring the speed and change of price movements.
    *   Interpretation: Values > 70 typically indicate overbought conditions; < 30 indicate oversold conditions.
*   **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**
    *   Periods: Short EMA (12-day), Long EMA (26-day), Signal Line (9-day EMA of MACD).
    *   Purpose: A trend-following momentum indicator showing the relationship between two moving averages.
    *   Interpretation: MACD line crossing above signal line is often a bullish signal; crossing below is bearish.
*   **Bollinger BandsÂ®:**
    *   Period: 20-day SMA for the middle band.
    *   Standard Deviations: 2 for upper and lower bands.
    *   Purpose: Measure market volatility. Prices are considered overbought near the upper band and oversold near the lower band.

### Fundamental Ratios

*(Primarily extracted from Yahoo Finance's summary data)*

*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** Market price per share / Earnings per share (EPS). Indicates investor expectations.
*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Company's profit allocated to each share. Growth in EPS is generally positive.
*   **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:** Market price per share / Book value per share. Compares market valuation to company's net asset value.
*   **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio:** Total liabilities / Shareholder equity. Measures financial leverage. *(Currently N/A in report; requires specific balance sheet parsing).*
*   **Dividend Yield:** Annual dividend per share / Stock's current price. Shows return from dividends.
*   **Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) Ratio:** P/E ratio / Annual EPS growth rate. Balances P/E with growth expectations. *(Often N/A if growth data isn't readily available in summary).*

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

*   More sophisticated inference engine.
*   Interactive charts (e.g., using Plotly or Bokeh).
*   Allowing users to customize indicator parameters.
*   Detailed industry/sector comparison for P/E ratios.
*   Calculation of D/E ratio from balance sheet data.
*   Portfolio analysis features.
